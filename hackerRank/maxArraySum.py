# Given an array of integers, find the subset of non-adjacent elements with the maximum sum. Calculate the sum of that subset. It is possible that the maximum sum is , the case when all elements are negative.

# Example
# arr = [-2,1,3,-4,5]

# The following subsets with more than  element exist. These exclude the empty subset and single element subsets which are also valid.

# Subset      Sum
# [-2, 3, 5]   6
# [-2, 3]      1
# [-2, -4]    -6
# [-2, 5]      3
# [1, -4]     -3
# [1, 5]       6
# [3, 5]       8

# The maximum subset sum is . Note that any individual element is a subset as well.


# In this case, it is best to choose no element: return .

# Function Description

# maxSubsetSum has the following parameter(s):

# int arr[n]: an array of integers
# Returns
# - int: the maximum subset sum

# Input Format
